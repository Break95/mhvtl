.SH NAME
vtllibrary \- user space daemon to handle SCSI SMC commands for Virtual Tape Library.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvtllibrary \-h\fR -- print a help message and exit, or
.br
.B vtllibrary
.I [OPTIONS]
\fB\-q\fR \fIQUEUE_ID\fR -- Emulate a tape library for queue \fIQUEUE_ID\fR.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
This command emulates a tape library device, using queue
.IR QUEUE_ID ,
which represent the message queue number used for this daemon.
This number is derived from the
.I device.conf
where it must be unique. Media files can be created using
.I OPTIONS
are from:
.TP
.B \-d
Enable debug logging (to stdout). Do not background the process,
and set verbosity to level 9.
.TP
.BI \-v[ N ]
Enable verbose logging (to syslog) at level \fIN\fR (default 1).
.TP
.B -F
Run in the foreground, not as a daemon.
.TP
.BI \-f FIFO
Near real time device state information will be available for external utilities by reading from this fifo. This switch has a higher precedence than the 'fifo:' entry in
.BR device.conf .
.PP
The
.B vtllibrary
daemon simulates a tape library device, and is started by
.BR systemd(1) ,
as needed, one invocation per Tape Library being simulated. The
.B vtllibrary
daemon registers each
.B vtltape(1)
via message queue. The
.B vtllibrary
reads @CONFIG_PATH@/library_contents.*
and dynamically builds an internal structure of Storage slots and Media Access slots.
All media movement is performed on internal structures only. The configuration file
is never changed, i.e. a re-start of the daemon will result in the loss of any
previous media movements.
.P
When media is moved to/from a "Data transfer element" (tape drive), a (un)load message is sent
via the drive 'slot number' message Q number to load/unload the barcode.
.SH FILES
